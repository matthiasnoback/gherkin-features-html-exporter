# Gherkin features HTML exporter

This library uses `behat/gherkin` (which is also used by Behat) to parse `.feature` files and renders HTML pages that you can style yourself, export to PDF, and show to other stakeholders.

## Getting started

Install using Composer:

```bash
composer require --dev matthiasnoback/gherkin-features-html-exporter
```

## Usage

```bash
vendor/bin/export-gherkin [features/] [export/] --stylesheet style.css
```

The stylesheet is *optional* and should be present in the provided `[export/]` directory.

For each `.feature` file in `[features/]` a corresponding `.html` file will be generated in `[export/]`.

### Merge all features into single file

This option allow you to output all html into a single file. Recommanded for small amount of features, but convenient if you want simply expose all your features.

```bash
vendor/bin/export-gherkin [features/] [export/] --stylesheet style.css --merge myFileName
```

### Combine features by tag

Another way to use this tool is to combine all features with a given tag in a single `.html` file named by that tag:

```bash
vendor/bin/export-gherkin [features/] [export/] --stylesheet style.css --tag wip
```

This will find all features tagged `@wip` and store them in a file called `[export/]wip.html`.

### Reformat HTML

There's an option to reformat the HTML before saving it:

```bash
vendor/bin/export-gherkin [features/] [export/] --reformat
```

## Demo

You'll find an `example.feature` in the [demo](demo/) folder, together with its generated `example.html`. The [`style.css`](demo/style.css) can be used as an example stylesheet. `example.html` was generated by running:

```bash
bin/export-gherkin demo demo --stylesheet style.css --reformat
```
